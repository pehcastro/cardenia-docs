# Cardenia City



![](<.gitbook/assets/1500x500 (1).jpg>)

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
**Early Concept:** All game-design systems, tokenomics and metaverse mechanics are under development and being revised daily. Thus, this whitepaper will be updated during our development journey, this is the latest and current version of our plans**.**
{% endhint %}

The lore, Cardenia is a lost city on the Cardano blockchain with a vast population, here you find normal humans, minions and zombies. Refugees from a statue, they use their identities to develop and improve the city they have chosen for themselves.

The city is made up of separate areas that were developed with the well-being of each citizen in mind. There you will find the city center, the residential district, residential condominiums, the commercial center buildings and the peripheral constructions of the city of Cardenia.

Cardenian holders will have free 2D environments to meet friends, hold public events, play mini games or work virtually to earn tokens. The city awaits you.

## Basic Concept

The project is developed by the community together with the team of developers, there are 2 paths to be followed and through them, we will develop the city of Cardenia together, we will use the voting system to guide how citizens want the city to be.

Once inside Cardenia you will have the freedom to be in a metaverse, play mini-games to farm NFTs, or put your citizens to work in a Player-To-Earn model where you can earn Cardenia $BUKZ tokens

These tokens will be available on Cardano's DEX, where you can SWAP to other tokens or ADA.

To enter Cardenia you will need to have a citizen NFT, this NFT must be in your Nami Wallet, linked to the browser on a computer or notebook to create you will be able to find a lobby or a multiplayer chat where you will have the freedom to interact with other citizens

{% tab title="Metaverse" %}
The Metaverse of Cardenia is a simulation of a city in 2d pixel art, a map that will be built through votes will be the place where new citizens will be able to put their nfts to use.



Public buildings with information about the city, mini-games, p2e, events, music stages, stripclubs and private rooms for mafias, gangs and professions will be in the city as a place to chill and hang out with friends



In addition to the entire public structure, a housing and customization system that can be integrated with play-to-earn. This means that your home, the decoration and the quality of the items you have here can complement your citizen's rest time when he is at the end of his workday.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Play-to-Earn" %}
A game mode where you earn for playing, most of the system works just like generic idle games you already know, but to be able to play and participate you need to have the necessary within the city's ecosystem, that is:

**Citizens:** Total stamina values for hours of work

**House:** The properties that will be up for voting in the next NFT drop

**Professions:** Job cards that determine the multiplied value you will receive



The set of 3 NFTS will give you the opportunity to work, relax and be part of the city. All work performed is accumulated and a daily amount is paid to each citizen.

## Development

We will be developing and adapting whatever is necessary to launch the project as a whole, so open testing and community members can join in to give us early feedback on Cardenia.

In order of development, we initially want::

* Create a multiplayer lobby&#x20;
* Develop the housing system
* Launch housable assets as NFTs (chairs, desks, tables etc)
* Make a open AIRDROP of $BUKZ for citizen holders&#x20;
* Insert other mini-games that can be played to earn in-game coins and mint NFT collections from drop crates
* Bring a in-game market in order to direct exchange your collections with other citizens
* Provide a means to create, through public buildings, private events held by community members (shows, festivals, meetings and other activities of the kind)
* Develop the P2E model to redeem tokens
* Develop the STAKE model to redeem tokens using NFTs



To understand how it is possible to build this environment with the community, you should first read about the [vote-system](community-development/vote-system/ "mention"), learn how to vote and how resolutions will be made.
