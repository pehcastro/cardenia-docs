# 📑 How to vote

### Step 1 - Nami Wallet

To vote you will need to have the Nami Wallet installed on your desktop browser and at least one citizen in that wallet. For now, you will need a computer to use the vote system as it is not possible to carry out voting by other devices such as Smartphones or tablets.

Installing Nami Wallet is quick and simple: After installing it on Safari, Chrome, or Brave browser, Write down and keep your Seed Phrase in a secure place. Here's their official link: https://namiwallet.io/ .

Next, start your wallet using the "Receive" button, there you will find an address starting with “addr1”, if you hold your citizen in another wallet, send them to this address.

If you are new to the project and don't have a citizen, consider minting it directly from the [cardenia.city/buy](https://cardenia.city/buy) website. 1 citizen can be minted for just 10 ADA. Newly minted citizens have a chance of being rare.

If you are having any issues with step 1 or any of the other steps below, please visit us at the official discord and ask for help.&#x20;

### Step 2 - Connect and claim

#### Connect

Access the voting dApp at https://votesystem.cardenia.city/.&#x20;

In the upper right corner, you will find the "Connect" button. Click on it to start the process of connecting your Nami Wallet.&#x20;

The necessary request by the dApp is to have the right to view and scan your wallet to find your Assets, we do this by identifying our Policy ID among your CNFTs, for each CNFT of our Policy ID in your wallet, 1 ticket will be added after using the Claim button.

After confirming and releasing the dApp's access to view your wallet, you should see where the "Connect" button was, the abbreviation for your wallet information, and by which means that you are connected.

**In Case You Sent the Wrong Nami Address**

Some users have more than one wallet address in their Nami Wallet. In case you sent the wrong address this is what you do: Clear up your cache (ctrl f5 or delete cookies), click on connect, check if the wallet connected when permission prompt showed. It is the same that you have an asset and sign in.

You can also ask for permissions one more time by resetting the allow dApps in your wallet

Open your wallet, click on the avatar, go to **Settings**, **Whitelisted Sites** and remove any related to **Cardenia City** domain.

#### Claim

Use the Claim button to redeem your voting tickets, you will be able to view each ticket redeemed in the upper right corner in number format.

\
**All tickets referring to citizens in your wallet will be redeemed at once**&#x20;

It is not possible to redeem more than one ticket for the same citizen.

In the lower right corner you will receive a message indicating the success in claiming your tickets or a warning if you try more than once.

If everything is ok and you see your tickets in the upper right corner, you can now choose what to vote for.
