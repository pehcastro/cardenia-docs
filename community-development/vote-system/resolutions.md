# ðŸ“‘ Resolutions

In order to create realistic proposals, voting options come from eternal team decisions and community suggestions. This is in order to prevent unrealistic or inappropriate goals being set. Initially, you will be able to request suggestions within our discord. We will leave an explicit channel (#suggestions) on our discord, and this channel can be used together to guide what we can put to a vote. We will use our internal votes as a team to select and create voting polls. From this process, we hope to create realistic voting options for future project goals.

In addition to the common votes related to the development of the project, we will also hold community votes for positions and other internal events, such as voting for mayor and staff, these votes are initially aesthetic conditions for the winners, such as positions, etc.

We will soon be able to discuss new resolutions and insert upgrades to the voting system so that the project, in the long term, will keep our amazing community healthy and active.
