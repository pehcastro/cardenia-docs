# üìë Citizens

{% hint style="danger" %}
**P2E under development:** We will discuss and plan this step again when the early metaverse processes are complete.
{% endhint %}

The 1st part of Cardenia City‚Äôs ecosystem are citizens. Citizens have a "time" to work. The time each citizen can work is defined by its overall rarity. ‚ÄúStamina‚Äù is what makes each citizen able to work harder.
Each trait rarity has higher multipliers for stamina that will give you an advantage in the overall calculation of how much you can work with that citizen.

Each payday will be calculated by the **total amount of hours worked**. 
More hours worked = more **BUKZ**

Every Citizen has **8 traits with 5 rarities**, each trait rarity will work as a multiply factor in how many hours your Citizen will be able to work.

**The overall calculations are based on a % of rarity that you can find here:** [https://cnft.tools/cardeniacity](https://cnft.tools/cardeniacity)

**The base stamina is 100 for 6 hours of work.**

**3,6 stamina per minute**

The sum of the multiplication factor of the eight traits will determine the value that will be multiplied by 100, resulting in a higher value of hours worked&#x20;

#### You will be able to work a maximum of 12 hours a day with a completely exotic citizen

| RARITY   | MULTIPLICATION FACTOR / TRAIT |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Common   | 0.125                         |
| Uncommon | 0.15                          |
| Rare     | 0.175                         |
| Epic     | 0.2125                        |
| Exotic   | 0.25                          |

#### As example, a 8 trait common citizen will be able to work:

<mark style="color:purple;">MP FACTOR X TRAIT AMOUNT = STAMINA MP FACTOR</mark>

&#x20;0.125 x 8 = 1

<mark style="color:purple;">STAMINA MP FACTOR X BASE  STAMINA = TOTAL STAMINA</mark>

1 x 100  = 100 total stamina&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">TOTAL STAMINA X STAMINA PER MINUTE = MINUTES OF WORK</mark>

100 x 3.6 = 360 minutes of work

#### As example, a 8 trait rare citizen will be able to work:

<mark style="color:purple;">MP FACTOR X TRAIT AMOUNT = STAMINA MP FACTOR</mark>

0.175 x 8 = 1,4

<mark style="color:purple;">STAMINA MP FACTOR X BASE  STAMINA = TOTAL STAMINA</mark>

1,4 x 100 = 140 total stamina

<mark style="color:purple;">TOTAL STAMINA X STAMINA PER MINUTE = MINUTES OF WORK</mark>

140 x 3.6 = 504 minutes of work

Basically, rare citizens will be able to work up to 8 hours and 24 minutes a day while common citizens will be able to work up to 6 hours at most.
