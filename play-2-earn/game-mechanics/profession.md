# Profession

{% hint style="danger" %}
**P2E under development:** We will discuss and plan this step again when the early metaverse processes are complete.
{% endhint %}

Profession in Cardenia will be our **last paid drop**, with the work we will be able to close the trinity of play 2 earn and **activate its functionality**.

There will be a job card for each citizen, the different job tiers will work similarly to citizen stamina mechanics.

Better jobs will give you better earnings multipliers, adding to more hours worked, it will be possible to redeem the best amount that Cardenia can pay you.

The types of jobs will be voted on by the community, here you will be able to define which jobs will exist in Cardenia and we will define the tiers that each one will be in, each job tier will bring the multiplication factor of the earnings with it, as citizen rarities can change the total hours of work each day

The calculation of earnings is done in a simple way:

&#x20;<mark style="color:red;">multiplication factor of profession X total hours worked</mark>
