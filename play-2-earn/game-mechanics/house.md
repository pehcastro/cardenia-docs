# House

{% hint style="danger" %}
**P2E under developmentt:** We will discuss and plan this step again when the early metaverse processes are complete.

Houses are places that will be available in 2 environments, in the metaverse and also in play 2 earn.

The role of houses in play 2 earn is to allocate citizens to rest, being able to rest more than one citizen per house, depending on the house.

This means that house lands will be limited to a lower drop and to rest you will need them, in addition to becoming attractively limited to the metaverse, it will make people who have no interest in playing play 2 earn to participate in the stake without having to work on our idle game.

Rest mechanics for houses will work with the rarities you already know, in addition to freeing up more blocks for furniture placement for your house, it will also give faster rest return to citizens depending on the levels.

Houses are global models in our metaverse and you can access them by entering their doors if you have the necessary NFT in your wallet.

Our next drop, **Homes**, will bring the necessary new information about these collectibles once the metaverse is ready for release,  this is the second part of our trinity.
