# ➡️ In-game Market

{% hint style="danger" %}
**To be developed:** After the initial tests of the housing system, we will proceed with the development of our marketplace.
{% endhint %}

In the future, the implementation of an internal market for our policy IDs can directly assist in the quick negotiations of assets. Here you can quickly list and buy using smart contracts ingame.

Once we have decided on the necessary paths and needs for an internal market, we will return to discussing internally how we best can implement a marketplace with our community in mind.\
