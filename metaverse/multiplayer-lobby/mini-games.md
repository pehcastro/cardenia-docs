Mini-games are a fun way to use your assets and participate in single-player or multiplayer games. Initially, they work as an exchange with the community, but we are planning to provide players with an internal currency that can buy boxes of collectibles for your home. <mark style="color:red;">**Some collectables will be pure collectables as others may offer in game or metaverse functionality**</mark>. Between having fun with friends and being at home, mini-games are a different way to socialize and interact with friends and other players.

#### Cardenia Soccer

{% hint style="success" %}
**This game is already running, and updates will be given over time. **
{% endhint %}

The first release is a "retro" styled tennis video game where you can choose a citizen, and he will be rendered in one of the areas of Cardenia City. A player will be able to use their citizen to score goals against the ‚ÄúZonnie‚Äù. Zonnie is our smart bot that will level up as you score more. Initially, this game helped us study asset identification and develop an animation of the 10,000 citizens that will be inserted into both our mini-games and open areas of Cadenia City.

Updates on Cardenia Soccer will allow us to identify the necessary means to continue other projects within Cardenia City, including multiplayer systems for mini-games, metaverse and play to earn.

First, of many other games to come, you will be able to choose to see your citizens in different types of games that will be put to choose from in our Vote System.
