The homes are 2D environments with a top-down view where you (a Cardenian CNFT holder) can customize the interior of the houses as you prefer. Initially, you will be able to visualize the type of construction in which your house or apartment is located, and you will have entry access to it if you have a property NFT in your wallet.

After the citizens sell out, we will have CNFT house drops for Cardenian holders. Meaning, you can receive houses and different structures, which may or may not contain a greater number of internal tiles for inserting objects. Note: The bigger the house; the greater its rarity.

We will launch to work as rewards of the mini-games collections of NFTs that can be used as furniture inside your house, being able to insert beds, sofas, rugs, cabinets, stove, television and others. All furniture will be introduced after the NFT housing and farm system go live. The inclusion of houses in the multiplayer system will make it possible in the future for you to get together with friends and be in an environment made by you.

Houses will also have specific functions and useful mechanics for the Play 2 Earn game, to learn more, see [game-mechanics](../../play-2-earn/game-mechanics/ "mention")
