CNFT rewards will be made in the form of in-game minting using our in-game currency, **Cardenia Gold**. **Cardenia Gold** will only be used within the game and cannot be transferred from one account to another. In addition, Cardenia Gold will work in a mirrored way with our servers to better secure players data.

CNFT collections will be available in crate formats. During minting, players will have options given from each crate from scripted vending machines. You will have the chance to pull from this crate an CNFT with low or high rarity level. Crates can have random multipliers that affect values and stats. Also, you may also receive more than one CNFT.

All our CNFT collections will be verified on secondary markets with their policies publicly available. We determine with the NAMI wallet and our game servers whether or not you own a specific CNFT through those policies, so replicas should never be used in Cardenia City.

To adjust for market volatility and promote a healthy marketplace: the amount of Cardenia Gold earned, Cardenia Golds value, the minting price, and secondary market saturation on products from these collections, will be adjusted whenever necessary by the original BUKZ value. We hope to make minting affordable and scalable whatever the market volatility will be.

In addition to earning with mini-games, it will also be possible to buy Cardenia Gold using your BUKZ for those who are interested in having the next CNFT collections. This is an option for players not very interested in farming coins by playing.

Every time you use **BUKZ** to buy **Cardenia Gold**, we will split the wallet that will receive the BUKZ from that buy between **Reserves** and **Stake**.
